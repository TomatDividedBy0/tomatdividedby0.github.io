						<i>“As man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy.” ― Pierre-Joseph Proudhon </i>

					<b>What you've answered in the previous two activities:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The cultural hegemony is responsible for determining the material and civic hegemony.</li>
						<li>Our current society's set of ethical values is something to embrace.</li>
						<li></li>
					</ul>	
					<b>What this more specifically means:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>It's our shared values such as respect and compassion that should guide the construction of our material and civic aspects of our society.</li>
						<li>Our system is one built around reconciling the ideas of various peoples and was the result of years of experimentation/compromise; we must defend it against extremists who are willing to discard our progress.</li>
						<li>All men are created equal; it is their actions/inactions define their character. </li>

				<b><h3>However, <u>the assessment is not over yet</u>. We can still get a more accurate approximation. </h3></b>
				<p>We have only completed the <i>canopy</i> section of the assessment. Now that we've narrowed down your leaf, from here will be a series of conditional yes or no questions, similar to the ones you just did on the previous page. With the process of elimination, we will be able to get a much more accurate reading of your beliefs.</p>
