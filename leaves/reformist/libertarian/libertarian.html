					<b><h3>You are traveling along the <u>Libertarian</u> leaf within the <span style='color: #EFE49E;'>Reformist</span> sector. </h3></b>			
						<i>“Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.” ― Milton Friedman </i>

					<b>What you've answered in the previous two activities:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The material hegemony is responsible for determining the cultural and civic hegemony.</li>
						<li>The current liberal conception of material value is something you seek to preserve.</li>
						<li>Your position in the material hierarchy is a result of your choices, not something inherent to you.</li>
					</ul>	
					<b>What this more specifically means:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>One's right to own property and participate in the market of competition is the basis on which all other rights rest.</li>
						<li>Free markets and freedom are inseparable; you cannot have one without the other, so it is imperative it must be defended.</li>
						<li>An ideal society puts forth equality of opportunity over equality of outcome.</li>

				<b><h3>However, <u>the assessment is not over yet</u>. We can still get a more accurate approximation. </h3></b>
				<p>We have only completed the <i>canopy</i> section of the assessment. Now that we've narrowed down your leaf, from here will be a series of conditional yes or no questions, similar to the ones you just did on the previous page. With the process of elimination, we will be able to get a much more accurate reading of your beliefs.</p>
