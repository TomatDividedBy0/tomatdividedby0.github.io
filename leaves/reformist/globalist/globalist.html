					<b><h3>You are traveling along the <u>Globalist</u> leaf within the <span style='color: #EFE49E;'>Reformist</span> cluster. </h3></b>			
						<i>“Our strategy for peace with freedom must also be based on strength -- economic strength and military strength. ” <br> ― Ronald Reagan </i>

					<b>What you've answered in the previous two activities:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The civic hegemony is responsible for determining the cultural and material hegemony.</li>
						<li>The current conceptions of civic order and ideals is something you seek to protect and spread.</li>
						<li>The value of a man is never less than that of another one, but the value of their ideals is subject to comparison.</li>
					</ul>	
					<b>What this more specifically means:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>The freedom of the individual to influence their government balanced with the structure a government provides is what determines the cultural and economic conditions a people are subject to.</li>
						<li>It is our duty as a society to protect and spread democratic ideals in all our handling of international and domestic issues.</li>
						<li>Democracy means no man's voice is greater than another. However, people's ideals must always be put to the test. And when the time comes, we must be willing to sacrifice ourselves for the furthering of our common values.</li>

				<b><h3>However, <u>the assessment is not over yet</u>. We can still get a more accurate approximation. </h3></b>
				<p>We have only completed the <i>canopy</i> section of the assessment. Now that we've narrowed down your leaf, from here will be a series of conditional yes or no questions, similar to the ones you just did on the previous page. With the process of elimination, we will be able to get a much more accurate reading of your beliefs.</p>
