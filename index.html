  <b> Why create <i>another</i>  political test? </b>
<br />
<p>Currently, two mainstream systems exist for gauging one's ideology, the spectrum approach and the scoring approach. 
The spectrum approach is familiar to most people, as it uses the concepts of progressive and conservative, in other words,
how one reacts to social progress to figure out their ideology. The glaring issue with this however is that progressive and 
conservative are relative terms. Relative not just to the time period and society, but also to the person making the assessment.</p>
<br />
<p>The scoring system on the other hand; more specifically political compasses and 8Values/9Axes/PolitiScales, tries to solve this by
using objective scores, but in the process loses the flexibility of the spectrums by asking questions that people might not even
be able to answer or might answer for different reasons. An anarchoprimitivist is not going to care what you do about sin taxes, 
so how do you distinguish their response from someone who just doesn't know what a sin tax is? What if someone wants higher taxes
in other areas, but is a frequent smoker and doesn't want to deal with hefty taxes on their tobacco? To hammer it in, these scores
are a neat novelty, but ultimately they're useless. A position on a grid tells me nothing about my ideology, just a vague idea
  of what similar scorers believe (which varies greatly, go figure).</p> 
<br />
<p>What this test does differently is that it takes the flexibility of the spectrum and combines it with the precision of the scoring-based methods. I like to 
think of it as a tree, with the canopy and leaves being represented by a table-esque base/superstructure method, and the branches being represented by a flowchart that aggressively narrows down your ideology once a leaf has been assigned.
