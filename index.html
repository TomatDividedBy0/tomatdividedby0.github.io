			<b><h3>Why create <i>another</i>  political test? </h3></b>
			<p>Currently, two mainstream systems exist for gauging one's ideology, the <b>spectrum approach</b> and the <b>scoring approach.</b></p>
			<p>The spectrum approach is familiar to most people, as it uses the concepts of <u>progressive</u> and <u>conservative</u>, in other words, 
			how one reacts to social progress to figure out their ideology. The glaring issue with this however is that progressive and conservative 
			are <u>relative</u> terms. Relative not just to the time period and society, but <i>also to the person making the assessment.</i></p>
			<p>The scoring systems on the other hand; more specifically political compasses and 8Values/9Axes/PolitiScales, try to solve this by
			using objective scores, but in the process loses the flexibility of the spectrums by asking questions that people might not even
			be able to answer or might answer for different reasons. An anarchoprimitivist is not going to care what you do about sin taxes, 
			so how do you distinguish their response from someone who just doesn't know what a sin tax is? What if someone wants higher taxes
			in other areas, but is a frequent smoker and doesn't want to deal with hefty taxes on their tobacco? To hammer it in, these scores
			are a neat novelty, but ultimately they're useless. A position on a grid tells me nothing about my ideology, just a vague idea of what 
			similar scorers believe (which varies greatly, go figure).</p></div>

			<b><h3>How does the test work? </h3></b>
			<p>This test uses what I have dubbed the <b>tree approach</b>, which can be divided into two components: <b>the canopy</b> and 
			<b>the branches</b>. The canopy (pictured above) consists of a triangular table that is divided into twelve leaves spread across 
			three segments. The assessment has you complete two activities before assigning you a leaf.</p>
			<p>From there, you will be given a set of typically less than five questions which vary based upon what your leaf is. 
			Because these questions branch out from under the different parts of the canopy, we refer to them as branches. 
			<u>Do not worry if you see terms you do not understand, they will be explained as we go along the test.</u></p>
